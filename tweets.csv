68,119308,"@105855 Hi Thomas, if a colleague believes the person buying alcohol looks under 25, they will be challenged for ID to prove they're of age. - Paige"
69,119309,@Tesco Maybe hire colleagues who can see?
70,119310,@Tesco The point is if it's enforced they do it properly or they don't. Plus take some common-sense and think does that person look over 18?
71,119311,"@105855 Hi Thomas, this is correct but this helps our store colleagues judge age and protect them from making underage sales. Amanda"
72,119313,@Tesco Uk offlicense law is 18. Not 25
73,119314,"@105855 Hi Thomas, we operate a Think 25 policy at our stores. I'd be flattered to be ID'd. :-) - Helena"
74,119315,Got id's @Tesco for buying one Adnams Broadside. Is being blind part of the job-spec? I am 35 and 99 kilos.
75,119317,"@105856 Hi there, could you try deleting your cache and cookies and reinstalling the app if using it? This should fix the issue :) - Dani"
76,119318,@Tesco Will I lose all the shopping I've done if I delete the cache/cookies (not using app)?
77,119320,"@105856 Hi there, as long as you sign out of your account prior to deleting your cache &amp; cookies, you'll still have a full basket :) Thanks - Mike"
78,119321,@Tesco Done all that. Still telling me there are no delivery slots whatsoever.
79,119322,"@105856 Can you DM me your full name, address and email? I'd be happy to look into this further for you :) Thanks - Mike"
80,119319,"Hey @Tesco, your website's broken. It's telling me there are no delivery slots for the next 3 weeks, which I find slightly unlikely."
81,119323,@105857 Is there a particular app that seems to cause these issues more than others? What model iPhone are you using? Join us in DM. https://t.co/GDrqU22YpT
82,119324,@AppleSupport I have the latest version iOS. It started immediately after I updated my phone.
83,119325,@105857 We'd like to help if we can. When did this start happening? Which version of iOS are you running currently?
